    <p><span class="text-uppercase"><strong>Note:</strong></span> The ratings for these trails are based on subjective comparison of trails
    within this system only. Newcomers are encouraged to begin their riding experience on a "beginner" trail. This will establish a base for moving onto an "intermediate" or "expert" trail segment. Riders assume all risk associated with skill level, trail difficulty, and conditions. The Town of Rangely, Rio Blanco County and Rangely Chamber of Commerce are not responsible
