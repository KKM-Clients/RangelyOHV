    <p><span class="text-uppercase"><strong>Note:</strong></span> The ratings for these trails are based on a subjective comparison of trails
    within this system only. Newcomers are encouraged to begin their riding experience on a "beginner" trail. This will establish a base for
    moving onto an "intermediate" or "expert" trail segment. Riders assume all risk associated with skill level, trail difficulty, and conditions.
